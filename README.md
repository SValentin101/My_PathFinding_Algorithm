# My_PathFinding_Algorithm

This proyect is an implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm. The visual aspect (main window, drawings of squares/nodes, buttons, text) was done using the SFML library.
The complexity that the main.cpp file could exhibit is mainly due to all the graphical aspect of this program.

All the code can be found in a single filed in the next location: Pathfinding Algorithm SFML/main.cpp

There is also a video in youtube where you can see it in action! --> LINK
