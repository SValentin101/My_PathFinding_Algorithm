# My_PathFinding_Algorithm

This proyect is an implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm. The visual aspect (main window, drawings of squares/nodes, buttons, text) was done using the SFML library.
The complexity that the main.cpp file could exhibit is mainly due to all the graphical aspect of this program.

All the code can be found in a single file in the next location: Pathfinding Algorithm SFML/main.cpp

I've also uploaded a video to youtube where you can see it in action! -->  https://youtu.be/RS1HwmjOYZs

I've also decided to update the code with the intention of increasing performance, since before, the algorithm took much more time than I wanted if the number of squares was increased. Now, that is no longer an issue. Another change implemented is to not allow for diagonal movement.

Feel free to check the new version in action! --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNGltfPC_gs&feature=youtu.be
